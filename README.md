## Abstract
<p>
Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer, with over 5 million cases diagnosed annually in the United States alone. Melanoma, the deadliest type, accounts for more than 7,000 deaths each year, while basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are more prevalent but generally less lethal. Early detection is critical, as the 5-year survival rate for melanoma is 99% when caught early, but it drops to 27% in advanced stages. This research investigates the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to improve early detection and classification of skin cancers, specifically targeting melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. A CNN model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of labeled dermoscopic images, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy compared to traditional methods.
<br><br>
The CNN model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score, with preliminary results indicating a significant improvement in identifying malignant lesions. For example, the model achieved over 90% accuracy in distinguishing between malignant and benign lesions, surpassing the average dermatologist's diagnostic accuracy. This study underscores the potential of CNNs to be integrated into clinical settings, offering a reliable, non-invasive, and cost-effective tool for early skin cancer detection, which could ultimately save thousands of lives annually by improving diagnostic precision and enabling timely treatment.
